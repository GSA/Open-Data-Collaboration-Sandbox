## Notes

* Don't publish datasets as one massive file (e.g. hundreds of megs).
* Instead, break it up into a folder structure that represents a static, RESTful API.  
* GitHub warns users for files over 50MB and blocks over 100MB, with the maximum recommended repo size being 1GB.  
  * Note [https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files)
